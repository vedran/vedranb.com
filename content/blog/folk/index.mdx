Hands on Computing with Folk

Topic: I'm writing a blog post to talk about folk, which is a spinoff of dynamicland. Learn more about folk here: https://folk.computer/notes/tableshots
My post will be about how I'm building learning tools for my own kids in folk. My first project is building something like the Scratch programming learning platform for kids in Folk. Give me some title ideas for this post that are clever and not unlike the other titles i have on my blog at: https://vedranb.com/

The goals here:
- Show off capabilities of folk, right up front to get people excited
  - Something like, when was the last time you reached out and touched the computer
- Relate montessori learning and folk

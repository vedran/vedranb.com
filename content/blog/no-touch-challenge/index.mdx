I touch my face all the time, and I'm barely aware that I'm doing it.

I built [notouchchallenge.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20200313040615/https://notouchchallenge.com/), powered by [handtrackjs](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/) to track how long I can go without touching my face, and playing a sound every time I do.

Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/vedran/notouchchallenge.com) for more details.
